# Uncharted Blockout Engine & Game

## Introduction
This repository contains a prototype engine combined with a simple game built on top of it.  
The project is designed to serve as both a foundation for experimentation and as a demonstration of how a modular engine structure can support an exploration-based game.  

The purpose of this project is to present a clear, well-structured environment while keeping certain internal technical details private.  
It aims to resemble a professional repository that could scale into larger developments.

---

## Project Overview
The project is divided into two major layers:

- **Engine Layer**: Provides the core systems responsible for managing scenes, movement, input, and interaction logic.  
- **Game Layer**: A blockout-level designed for exploration and prototype gameplay.  
- **Documentation**: Organized in a way that allows future extensions, updates, and additional notes.  

---

## Features
- Expandable environments suitable for iterative level design.  
- Modular engine structure that makes it possible to add or remove components without rewriting the entire project.  
- Dynamic movement and camera control for fluid exploration.  
- Support for basic rendering, audio, and interaction systems.  
- Clear folder organization that separates engine code from game-specific logic.  

---

## Requirements
To build and run the project successfully, the following tools are required:

- **Visual Studio 2022** (with C++ development workload installed).  
- **CMake** (latest stable version recommended).  
- **Git** (for cloning and version control).  

Optional but recommended:
- A modern Windows 10/11 environment.  
- Sufficient hardware to run real-time rendering and development tools.

## Building the Project
There are two main ways to get the project running:

### Option 1: Using Git and CMake
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dempow12/UnchartedBlockout.git
